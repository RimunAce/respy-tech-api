- In the future, more accessible endpoint will be added (until I feel like I want them).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm :3

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rimunace/respy-tech-api.git
cd respy-tech-api
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Example environment variables

# Setup IP and PORT
IP=
PORT=3000

# CORS SETUP
# You can set-up a CORS origin to allow only certain origins
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://domain.com,https://domain2.com

# API-Server Key SETUP

# Store your Key in DigitalOcean Spaces
# If you prefer to use other storage, make sure to change the code in:
# src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts

# You can also opt to leave this empty and use local key saving

DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT=
DO_SPACES_REGION=
DO_SPACES_BUCKET=
DO_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
DO_SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

# Setup API Key - Make sure provider's name is lowercase
openai=your_openai_api_key
anthropic=your_anthropic_api_key
google=your_google_api_key

# ... // Add more API keys as needed

# API CONFIG
ASSUME_ALL_MODELS_SUPPORT_IMAGES=true # Set to true to assume all models support image inputs. If false, modify "modelSupportsImages" function in "utils/providerUtils.ts"
```

### API Key System
This API will not work without an API key. 

If you prefer to use local key saving, you can set-up the following folder structure:
```
root
|-- key
    |-- API-KEY-1.json
    |-- API-KEY-2.json
    |-- ...
```

Make sure your key is saved as the `<API-KEY>.json>` with the following format:
```json
{
    "id": "API-KEY",
    "premium": false, // Set to true if the key is for premium models
    "generated": "04/08/2024", // Date of key generation
    "created_for": "Jane Doe", // Who the key is for
    "raw_data": {
        "expiration": "12/12/2025", // Set to "never" if the key never expires
        "usage_limit": "15" // Set to "unlimited" if the key has unlimited usage
    },
    "created_by": "System Admin" // Who created the key
}
```
The format for using DigitalOcean Spaces is the same as above.

If you want to automatically generate a key, too bad I don't have the time to implement that... :P

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Set-Up

To configure your models, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Configuration File:**
   Go to the `models/config-example.json` file in your project directory.

2. **Edit the Configuration:**
   Update the file with your desired model details. Below is an example configuration:

   ```json
   {
       "type": "list",
       "models": [
           {
               "id": "gpt-3.5-turbo", // Your model id
               "name": "GPT-3.5 Turbo", // Your model name
               "owned_by": "openai", // Who owns this model
               "premium": false // Should only premium members access this model
           },
           {
               // ...Add more models as needed
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Save the File:**
   Ensure you save the changes and rename file to `config.json`.

4. **Add More Models:**
   You can add more models by following the structure provided in the example.

Once your model is set-up, you need to set-up your providers by following the steps below:

1. **Navigate to the Configuration File:**
   Go to the `providers/chat-completions-example.json` file in your project directory.

2. **Edit the Configuration:**
   Update the file to your provider's format:
   ```json
   {
    "providers": [
      {
        "name": "openai",
        "endpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        "models": {
          "gpt-3.5-turbo": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
          "gpt-4": "gpt-4",
          "gpt-4-turbo": "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "anthropic",
        "endpoint": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
        "models": {
          "claude-3-opus-20240229": "claude-3-opus-20240229"
        }
      }
      // ...Add more providers as needed
    ]
   }
   ```
   *Note: You need to save the provider's API key in `.env` file as the variable name is the same as the provider's name.*

3. Save the file and rename it to `chat-completions.json`.
4. Add more providers by following the same structure as the example above.

5. **Configure Image Support:**
      - Set `ASSUME_ALL_MODELS_SUPPORT_IMAGES=true` in your `.env` file to enable image support for all models.
      - If set to `false`, only models explicitly defined as supporting images in `src/controllers/chatCompletions/utils/providerUtils.ts` will accept image inputs.


### Running the Server

To build the project and run, execute:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The API service uses clustering to enhance performance and scalability.

### OpenAPI Specification

This project supports OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification to describe the API endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication methods. To set this up:

1. Create an `openapi.yaml` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Use the provided `openapi-example.yaml` as a template and customize it for your specific API implementation.

Key features to include in your OpenAPI specification:

- Detailed descriptions of all API endpoints
- Request and response schemas for each endpoint
- Authentication requirements (Bearer token)
- Tags for logical grouping of endpoints
- Contact information for API support

To view or interact with the API documentation:

1. Start the server as described in the "Running the Server" section.
2. Access the OpenAPI specification JSON at `http://localhost:3000/openapi.json` (replace with your actual host and port).
3. Use tools like Swagger UI, Redoc, or Postman to import this specification and generate interactive documentation.

The OpenAPI specification provides a standardized way to understand and interact with the API, making it easier for developers to integrate and use the Respy Tech API in their projects.
